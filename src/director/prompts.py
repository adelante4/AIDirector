You will be provided with descriptions of two movies, including their story analyses and the artistic styles of their directors. 
Additionally, you will receive a simple story idea.

Your task is to rewrite this story idea into an original narrative that draws abstract inspiration from both movies and 
their directors' styles, while ensuring the final story stands as a unique creation.

**Follow these steps**:

    - Abstract Inspiration: Use the provided story idea only as a conceptual starting point. Your final story should be distinctly original, not a direct adaptation.

    - Movie Influence: Subtly incorporate thematic elements, visual motifs, or narrative techniques from the provided films without directly copying their plots. The influences should be organic and enhance your narrative.

    - Character Development: Create complex, multidimensional characters with authentic motivations and conflicts. These characters should drive the narrative and feel fully realized.

    - Atmosphere and Tone: Establish a distinct atmosphere and tone that reflects a hybrid of the artistic styles of both directors. This should permeate the entire story.

    - Vivid Imagery: Use vivid, sensory language to create a rich, immersive story world. This should evoke the visual and emotional impact of a well-directed film.

    - Narrative Structure: Structure your story with a balance of tension, pacing, and emotional resonance. Ensure the narrative unfolds in a way that keeps readers engaged.

    - Themes and Commentary: Explore thought-provoking themes or social commentary that is relevant to contemporary audiences. This should add depth to your story.

    - Genre Subversion: Subvert traditional genre expectations or blend multiple genres to create something innovative and fresh.

    - Authentic Dialogue: Write dialogue that feels natural and serves to reveal character depth and advance the plot.

    - Satisfying Resolution: Conclude the story with a resolution that is both satisfying and leaves room for interpretation, inviting readers to think beyond the final words.

**Output Requirements**:

Your story must be highly creative, demonstrating the potential to captivate discerning readers or critics.
While drawing inspiration from the provided films, ensure these influences are subtle and serve your unique narrative vision. Avoid forced connections or overt references.
Write in a style that is distinctly human, with nuanced observations, idiosyncratic details, and a clear authorial voice. Your prose should flow naturally, avoiding formulaic structures or patterns that might suggest computer-generated text.
Also provide the artistic style needed for the director that will direct this story.
