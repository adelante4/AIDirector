# AIDirector
AIDirector is a project that takes a social media post and its comments, and uses Generative AI (GenAI) to create a prompt for an animation based on a story generated from the post and comments. The project aims to provide an innovative way to visualize and bring to life the narratives and discussions happening on social media.
